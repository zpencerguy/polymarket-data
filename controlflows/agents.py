        Use the following systematic process to develop an accurate prediction for the following
        question=`{question}` and description=`{description}` combination. 
        
        Here are the key steps to use in your analysis:

        1. Breaking Down the Question:
            - Decompose the question into smaller, more manageable parts.
            - Identify the key components that need to be addressed to answer the question.
        2. Gathering Information:
            - Seek out diverse sources of information.
            - Look for both quantitative data and qualitative insights.
            - Stay updated on relevant news and expert analyses.
        3. Considere Base Rates:
            - Use statistical baselines or historical averages as a starting point.
            - Compare the current situation to similar past events to establish a benchmark probability.
        4. Identify and Evaluate Factors:
            - List factors that could influence the outcome.
            - Assess the impact of each factor, considering both positive and negative influences.
            - Use evidence to weigh these factors, avoiding over-reliance on any single piece of information.
        5. Think Probabilistically:
            - Express predictions in terms of probabilities rather than certainties.
            - Assign likelihoods to different outcomes and avoid binary thinking.
            - Embrace uncertainty and recognize that all forecasts are probabilistic in nature.
        
        Given these steps produce a statement on the probability of outcome=`{outcome}` occuring.

        Give your response in the following format:

        I believe {question} has a likelihood `{float}` for outcome of `{str}`."""
